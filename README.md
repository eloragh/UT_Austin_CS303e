## Introduction
This repository holds all of my assignments and projects for CS303e Elements of Computing in the Spring 2022 semester at The University of Texas at Austin. CS303e is an introductory Python course covering basic data structures, loops, conditionals, functions, classes, and recursion.

## [Assignments](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/tree/main/Homework)

[Easter Sunday](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Homework/EasterSunday.py)

  - An algorithm that can identify the date of Easter Sunday for any given year.

[DaysInMonth](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Homework/DaysInMonth.py)

  - This program returns the number of days in a given month within a given year.

[Payroll](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Homework/Payroll.py)

  - This program recieves input about an employee and outputs a payroll statement.

[MyStringFunctions](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Homework/MyStringFunctions.py)

  - A series of functions to be used on strings.

[MinMax](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Homework/MinMax.py)

  - This program recieves *N* number of integers and returns both the minimum and maximum.

[FindPrimeFactors](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Homework/FindPrimeFactors.py)

  - This program returns the prime factorization of a number *N*.

[Student](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Homework/Student.py)

  - This program defines a class "Student" and methods that relate to the student's grades.

[Wordle Assistant](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Homework/WordleAssistant.py)

  - This program contains a series of helper functions that will be used in the Wordle Project.

[Control Game](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Homework/ControlGame.py)

  - This program defines a class and a series of methods to run the "Control Game".

## Projects

[Unit Converter Project]

[Fibonacci Project](https://github.com/eloragh/UT-Austin-CS303e/blob/main/Projects/FibonacciProject.py)

  - This project contains a series of functions that can be used to express and manipulate numbers within the Fibonacci sequence, including:
    - return the first *N* numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence.
    - return the *ith* number of the Fibonacci Sequence.
    - return Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to *N*.
    - return the number of Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to *N*.
    - return the Fibonacci numbers that sum up to *N* based on [Zeckendorfs Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf%27s_theorem).
